# Email Spam Detection with Naive Bayes

## Overview

Email Spam Detection with Naive Bayes is a simple project that aims to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The project demonstrates how to preprocess email text, create a Bag-of-Words model, train the Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled emails, where spam emails are labeled as "spam" (1) and non-spam emails are labeled as "ham"(0). The dataset should be preprocessed and split into training and testing sets before running the code.

## Installation

To run the code, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Use

Prepare the Dataset: Ensure you have the labeled email dataset (spam and ham) ready for training and testing.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the email text, removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing the text.

Feature Extraction: Create a Bag-of-Words model using the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to represent the email text as numerical features.

Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

Train the Naive Bayes Classifier: Train the Naive Bayes classifier on the training set.

Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or other appropriate metrics.
